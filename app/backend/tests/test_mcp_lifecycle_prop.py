"""Property test: Subprocess Lifecycle — Lazy Spawn and Reuse.

**Validates: Requirements 1.1, 1.2**

For any sequence of tool calls targeting the same MCP server, the first call
SHALL trigger exactly one subprocess spawn, and all subsequent calls SHALL
reuse that same subprocess (no additional spawns occur while the process is alive).
